# Android App for MDP Team 18 (AY18/19 Sem 2)

It was my first time working on a pure android app and at the same time, use bluetooth to connect to other hardware.
I picked up how to configure and harness the Bluetooth API provided by Google, as well as handle asynchronous tasks running
in parallel with the main activity. Overall, our robot did pretty well in the maze exploration, fastest path and image recognition challenges (1st place!).

I also had some fun with the app design as well ;)
